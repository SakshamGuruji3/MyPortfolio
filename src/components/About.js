            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a blockchain technology enthusiast who is majorly inclined towards Smart
                Contract security/auditing and have solved multiple CTF's and challenges 
                to prove and polish my skills in the area of Smart Contract auditing/security. I 
                keep myself updated with all the recent hacks/attacks and about the blockchain 
                ecosystem in general. I have developed a passion for smart contract security 
                and want to be part of a team where I can grow and prove my skills
                as a Smart Contract Auditor.
