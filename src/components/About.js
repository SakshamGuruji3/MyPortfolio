                in the blochchain world , all the recent attacks/hacks on different platforms and new
                techgnologies introduced. Using my knowledge of blockhain , writing tests and frontend development

                Contract security/auditing and have completed multiple CTF's and challenges , read every article available
                and watched every video to polish my skills in the area of auditing.I have developed a passion
                for smart contract security and want to be part of a team where I can grow and prove my skills
